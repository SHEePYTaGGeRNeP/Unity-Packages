# Unity-Packages

### BaseClass.unitypackage
Use this for your baseclass from which all your MonoBehavior components inherit. This is also replaces your singleton pattern.
At the moment this class has the functionality to hold references you want to reach from anywhere in your code ( just like the singleton ) only it isn't static.
It also has methods to instantiate GameObjects and puts them in a Dynamic Objects gameobject.

### CustomEffects.unitypackage
Use this for particle-, soundeffects and all others. Just place the CustomSoundEffect component onto an object.
You can use this to make a list of Effects that need to be played instead of a Sfx and a particle system and other effects.

### MainMenuGameJamTemplate.unitypackage
This is an edited version of the Main Menu Game Jam Template from Unity. Better scaling for mobile, plus a feature to test sounds.

### NewUnityGamePackage.unitypackage
This package puts some folders in your project to keep it nice and structured.

### Photonnetworking.unitypackage
This package contains a lobby scene and does all the connecting stuff for you. Great example with a shitty UI on how Photon works and plug and play system that works instantly. However you do have to have the Photon package installed.

### SimpleSaveAndLoad.unitypackage
Simple way of saving and loading files. Serializes and Deserializes classes.

### UnityHelpers.unitypackage
Alot of helper classes including the LogHelper class, lots of extension methods, MathFx, StopwatchHelper, FPSDisplay and many more.

### VersionControlUnityGame.unitypackage
Sets the Editor settings to work well with version control (only tested for Git).
